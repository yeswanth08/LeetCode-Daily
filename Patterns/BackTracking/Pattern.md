## BackTracking Patterns 

    > Boolean Array -> we take a boolean array to track the availaility of the element 
        > used in all possible patterns
    > Swap based -> modify in place
    > incude / exculude -> we take an empty string or array and we have a option for including and excluding 
    > making visited in 2d array -> grid - based (dfs)
    > loope over multiple choices -> trying all different combinations 
    > hashset -> to track the duplicacy
