### Backtracking and Recursion Solution 

    > generate all the possible patterns using recursion and explore all the paths 
    > backtracking main theme is that to return the prev result and on the basis of the prev result we take the decision 
    > so backtracking has a boolean return type where is returns the prev result to stop or procced with the furture computations

#### Backtracking => optimizing the recursion by exploring all the paths and returning the prev computed result 

### StringBuilder vs String

    > StringBuilder => Mutable => whenever you modify the SB it doesn't create a new object is modifies in the same object . (Good for memory optimizations)
    > String => immutable => whenever you modify the String it creates a new OBJ
    for each modification. Therefore, We have differnet memory locations to each
